# GIT INIT

- initializes a project in local directory

# GIT COMMANDS

- git remote add origin git@github.com:loopback1/test (ssh)

  - links current local project to remote github project

- git remote add origin git@github.com:loopback1/test (https)

  - same as above but https

- git push -u origin master

  - push code from local repo called master to remote

- git clone git@github.com:loopback1/test.git

  - clone remote to local using ssh

- git pull origin master

  - updates local repo with latest version
  - git

- git add filename.md

  - stages file

- git reset HEAD file name

  - unstage file

- git checkout -b newbrachname (staging)
  - create new branch
  - changes made in new branch can be merged into master
  - work on branch to keep master in working order
- git branch -d newbranchname (delete branch)

# GIT WORKFLOW

- modified files -> staged files (using git add)
  -> staged files -> commited files (git commit -m)
  -> commit -> pushed files (git push)

# BRANCHING

# CHECK OUT NEW BRANCH

git checkout -b branchname

# PUSH ORIGIN (LOCAL) TO BRANCHNAME AND SETUP TRACKING

git push -u origin branchname

# CHANGE TO MASTER BRANCH

git checkout master

# CHANGE TO 'BRANCHNAME' BRANCH

git checkout branchname

# CHECK CURRENT BRANCH

git status

# FETCH FROM REMOTE (FETCH IS SAFE AND DOES NOT OVERWRITE LOCAL)

git fetch

# CHECKOUT A NEW BRANCH UNDER DIFFERNT NAME

git checkout -b devbranch origin/devbranch

# MERGE DEVBRANCH TO MASTER

switch to devbranch 'checkout devbranch'
git merge master
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff devbranch # push to github
git push -u origin master

# DELETE REMOTE AND LOCAL BRANCH

git push origin --delete branch

# UPSTREAM REPOSITORIES

- used when forking a repo but we need to keep our local copy
  in sync with the original master

* after cloning a forked repo, tell the forked version
  that there is an upstream original repo as well

git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/repo.git

- check all remotes
  git remote -v

- fetch from upstream to update forked local repo
  git fetch upstream

- move to local master branch
  git checkout master

- merge changes from upstream original master into local master
  git merge upstream/master

# GIT STASH

- temporary storage for changes not ready to commit
- useful when having to switch branches when not ready to commit

git stash

- get changes out of stash
  git stash pop --index
